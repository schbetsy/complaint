      <h3>Designed for every device</h3>

      <p class="sans">Capital Framework has been written to work with a wide range of devices and browsers. Following a modern, mobile first responsive approach, sites easily adapt to wide range of screen sizes all while carefully following accessibility best practices. Capital Framework supports and actively tests for support in IE7+, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, iOS6+, Android 4+, and the Blackberry Bold to ensure that our sites can meet the needs of as many users as possible.</p>

      <h3>A solid project starter</h3>

      <p class="sans">Setting up the framework for your project and creating new components should be quick and easy. By using our <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> generator, you not only get access to a collection of <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a>, CSS, and JavaScript files, but also a modern front end build process. The generator scaffolds out a project directory, package.json file, and a starter <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> file, allowing you to quickly spin up a new project. Each of these files can easily be adapted to meet the needs of a developer, while providing examples of best practices.</p>

      <h3>Component based architecture</h3>
      <p class="sans">Each Capital Framework component is its own repository. Components can be used by themselves, but they can easily be compiled to work together. We rely on <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> and <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> to manage the downloading and updating of components and their dependencies within a project. This setup provides a lot of flexibility and makes it easier for projects using the framework to take advantage of updates and bug fixes at their own convenience.</p>
